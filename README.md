# Bezier-Curves
Python project for visualizing and manipulating Bézier curves. The project demonstrates how to construct a composite Bézier curve that approximates a circle using four cubic Bézier curves. It includes an interactive slider to adjust one of the control points dynamically, allowing users to observe how the curve changes in real time.
